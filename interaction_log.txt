Question: What is this image about?
Response: This image is about a 3D plotting code snippet and its corresponding output, likely from a computer algebra system (CAS) such as SageMath. 

The code defines a function `f(x, y) = x*y*exp(-x^2 - y^2)` and plots it in 3D over the range `x = -2 to 2` and `y = -2 to 2`. 

The output is likely a 3D surface plot of the function, although the actual plot is not visible in the provided text. The text appears to be a representation of the code input and output in a Jupyter notebook or similar environment.
